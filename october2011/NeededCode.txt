Code Needed:

GraphicsManager:
Needs to sort back to front all graphics via Transform, Shader, Material, Index, Vertex

SpriteManager:
Load up TextureDefinition files to create a bunch of Sprite Meshes for Entities to pull off.

Texture Definition:
texture file name - relative path
sprite name
u, v, w, h

This could be a set of structs to speed up loading - load the entire file in one glob for example, rather than parsing through it line by line.

EntityManager:
Load up EntityDescriptions to load completed Entities.

Entity Description:
Type
Amount
data corresponding to type struct


Need to fix up Resource so that the id is a HashString rather than a standard Uint.
This requires the Resourcebank to be modified so that it doesn't use the resource id as the index value to the array.

Input Manager
Need to catch the System Events which the Event System spits out.. nothing is currently picking them up, so we can't close the window to quit, for example.
Also should probably use this to send notifications of movement to other systems.

Texture should probably be split up so we can deal with compressed texture formats - such as ETC1 for ES 2.0 platforms, PVR for Apple and some Android platforms, ATITC for other Android platforms and DXT/S3TC for some Android platforms and Desktop platforms

GameCamera Manager:
Should be able to just pinch this from Fingers.


Rough Design for Quirks:

Guide the Quirks from the Starting Point to the End Point in each level.
Quirks will constantly wriggle in a straight line and will climb walls of a 45degree angle.
If they hit a 90degree angle they turn around and wriggle the other direction.
Click/Touch and hold on the screen to get the tile menu up - drag left for environment tiles, drag right for contraptions.
Limited amount of environment and contraption tiles available - shown via a number in the corner of the tile.
Click/Touch both buttons/fingers and drag to move the map around.
Click/Touch a contraption to interact with it.

Menu System:

[ ] [ ] [ ]   [ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [X] [ ] - [ ] [X] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]   [ ] [ ] [ ]


Contraptions:
Gates - will allow Quirks to enter in one direction. Tap it to change the direction they're allowed to pass.
Catapult - will lob Quirks a fair distance across the level. Tap it to launch a Quirk.

Impelement Box2D for collision handling.
Should be especially useful if linked with Lua the same way as the Pb Prototype System
We need to store a void pointer in a Box2D object to get back to our Actor... this should be a Reference pointer, and should expose Instance and Remove to the public interface.
