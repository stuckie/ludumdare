Collected LudumDare Entries

Older Lua-based projects are likely just Win32 binary with script source.
You'd probably have luck compiling the last SGZ2D release and running the project with that, if you need a non Win32 build. though.
Later Lua-based projects are also more Lua-centric, so could have their interfaces fiddled with to run on whatever you like.

Some projects are not Lua based, and so have the majority of their code in here, along with any dependices if required.

All LudumDare entires from myself shall be placed here from now on, so feel free to clone, fork, poke and prod!
