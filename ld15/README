Moons of Subterrane - LD15
--------------------------
Steven "Stuckie" Campbell

Plot:
We've been doing research around the Moons of Subterrane for a while now,
though unfortunately the locals have decided they're not too happy about it anymore.

They've unleashed a horde of vicious monsters into the caves we have been researching in.
Your job is to clear these caves and rescue our researchers.
Of course, the natives have also managed to destabalise each sector of the Moon we're in,
so you've only got a set amount of time before it tears itself apart!

You ship is controlled via the Arrow Keys.
Z acts as a firing mechanism
X will transport researchers between your ship and whatever station you've landed on.

Good Luck!

Oh the fun this was.
I probably only spent about 24 hours on it max... wouldn't be too hard to extend either.

Sounds were done in MilkyTracker via messing with the debug log as a sample source ;)
The engine does run on the Wiz and Dingoo, but I don't think I've got the buttons mapped, so it may run but not do anything.

Full source code is provided though!

I only managed to properly map out Chronos and the first two sectors of Kala.
The rest are repeats of Chronos with random gravity values, and different tilemaps ( colour shifts, wooo )

Hope you enjoy it :)
