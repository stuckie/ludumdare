YARGH! - Shake Yer Booty!
=========================

It's not quite complete.. there's a number of things missing but I've spent most of this weekend fighting with my engine and chasing obscure list bugs, sadly.
I'm releasing as is; there's still a lot there and it's amusing to see just how vicious the computer can actually be at times.
It's sheer bedlam!

I did atleast fix the bug that they'd go and absolutely destroy all the forts and mines immediately after starting ;)
Granted, you can't pillage the mines or forts ( it refused to pick up the buttons for some reason ) but hopefully this'll be a quick fix later.

I've enjoyed this Ludum Dare.. it's been a fun game to work on :)
Engine issues aside, of course...

Anyway, brief controls:
Left Click on your ship to select it.
Right Click moves it.
Arrow Keys or moving the mouse to the edge of the screen pans the camera.

While a unit is selected:
Hold LEFT Control and Right click an enemy unit to attack it.
Hold LEFT Shife and Right click on the ground to board/disembark from a ship ( depending on whether you're controlling a ship or man at the time )

Apologies that I didn't get this finished as much as I'd have liked...
And I shall say the usual - I'll try and continue it where possible!

Hope you at least enjoy wandering around and seeing the computer cause mayhem ;)

Oh, and you can change the screen resolution in the data/scripts/config.sgz ( just a text file )
640x480 is a bit cramped, 1024x768 was what it was developed in, but I'm sure you can ramp it up if you like.

Thanks :)
