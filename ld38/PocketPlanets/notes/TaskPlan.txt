Outline of Tasks
----------------

Doing the Competition so we have 48 hours.
Starting "late" as went to sleep normally.. time is currently 10:30am - 8.5 hours into it.
As there's no way that I can do a straight battering throughout the weekend, lets work out a plan...

Saturday
--------

10.30 - 11am
These notes; sort out ideas and get basic project up and running, committed, etc..
Pick main test platform ( probably HTML5 so more people can play it, and to stop little surprises again like last time - hello, randomize() )

< -- YOU ARE HERE -- >
11 - 12pm
Mock up graphics for ships and planets ( read: arrows and circles )
Work on System generation, to scatter Planets about the screen.
This'll basically be Galaxy generation too, just instead of planets, it's systems... different icon on screen, and different data structure but same idea

12 - 7pm
Probably busy with other things..

7 - 8pm
Work on Planet generation, and get slots working for each building type.
Make sure Planet stats update as accordingly.

8 - 9pm
Work on Ship generation.
Get ships to move from A->B.

9 - 10pm
Get resources moving about between Planets via Ships

10 - 11pm
Work on Research trees to make better Ships to do more things

11 - 12am
Work on Space Stations so we can create things in space closer to Asteroid belts, anomolies, etc..

Sunday
------

12 - 1am
Test build.. Should hopefully have small playable at this point of a generated System, with multiple Planets, and lots of little Ships milling about.

1am - 8am
Sleep...

8 - 9am
Test build.. nothing broke overnight? Everything still playable? Still feel "fun"?
Work out bug list and task list for rest of the day

9 - 10am
Work on getting to other galaxies.. so tears and the permanant solution ( warp gates, probably )

10 - 11am
Basic Passive AI for other species..

12 - 8pm
Likely other things...

8 - 9pm
Basic Aggressive AI for other species.. so work on ship - ship attack, and ship - planet attack
Damage for ships and planets and buildings and repair works etc...

9 - 10pm
Test Build.. so we should have a fully working game at this point.. see there's no major bugs

10 - 11pm
Sound effects

11 - 12am
Music

12 - 1am
Polish? Tidy up?

1 - 2am
Test Build and Submit .. and pray Monday isn't too demanding

Total "guaranteed" work hours: 15
That's tight...
Total "possible" work hours: 31 - say 3 for eating - 28
Likely somewhere around 20.. much like Mini Dungeon Adentures.. but we're going in just after a jam, so still have the momentum.
That's the theory...
