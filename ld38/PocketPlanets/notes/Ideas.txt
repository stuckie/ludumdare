Ok so.. A Small World.

Immediate idea is that of a small Farmville-esque thing, of a little world that you build things in, reap resources, and build bigger things.
I've just done the 1 Bit Clicker Jam which that was effectively the idea; and I went down a different rabbit hole with Mini Dungeon Adventures...
So, lets do the same with this one...

Better idea is a small 4X strategy thing.
You therefore have many "small worlds" which you need to maintain.
Tootle about the galaxy and do your thing.
Need to think of end game conditions... survive 10,000 years or something? Wipe out some nasty enemy?
Oh and there's AI to think of too... can probably get away with something simple for the time being though.

Another idea in the same kind of vein... space-transport tycoon?
Build space busses to ferry passengers back and forth?
Interplanetary space routes?
Upgrade ships to handle different life forms?
Perhaps strays a bit too far from A Small World... whereas the 4X thing could have the Small World as your homeworld, and of course the others you colonise.

Hmm.. think it's going to be the 4X thing.
Names... Pocket Galaxies? Pocket Planets? Tiny Galaxy? Tiny Worlds? Tiny something is probably trademarked somewhere.. so lets go with Pocket Planets...
Means we can sortof riff on the pocket thing and you can jump galaxies by creating a tear in space.. as if a pocket as been torn and things escape to explore elsewhere.. 
Ok, yep, like that... lint and fluff monsters travelling around pockets, getting to new galaxies due to tears in the fabric *cough*
