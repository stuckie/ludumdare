potentially complex

Plunder Bunnies

=====================================================

Splodge
-------

Splodge is a silly-putty like thing whose ship has malfunctioned and crashed on some unknown planet. He has to find the bits of his ship to put back together again and avoid the local nasties. He can absorb things to gain their properties to get past puzzles:

Magnets to attach to metal things ( walk up walls/along ceilings! )
Hooks to swing about the place ( uses his tongue as rope! )
Balloons to float up ( inflates himself! )

Platformer with two buttons - absorb/desorb, action.
Standard action is to jump.

I like this.. let's go with this!

======================================================

Germies
-------

6x5 grid of coloured germs.
Match them in similarly coloured rectangles to score points.
All germs slowly turn Black and rot.
Once rotten, they quickly infect nearby cells and can only be removed by "scrubbing"
Game Over when entire grid is infected.

sortof.. I did it anyway though it doesn't match this discription much!
