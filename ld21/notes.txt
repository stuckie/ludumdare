"Thieving Fingers"

COMPILE NOTES:
Compile the engine first...
cd glesgae; make -f Makeoptlib.platform; cd ..
Then compile fingers...
cd fingers; make -f Makefile.platform
Should then be able to run it...
./fingers.platform

Where "platform" is your host OS ( IE: linux, win32, etc.. )


GAME DESIGN NOTES:
You are Fingers, a notorious jewel thief, well known for getting in and out of the highest security buildings to claim your prize.
When news of the Star Diamond being moved to a new facility broke, you got a mysterious offer to test their security.
If you got through, you not only got the diamond, but enough money to never need to work again.
They left out what happens if you fail, but you've never failed yet... right?

Top down or Side-scrolling?
Need to tile either way.
Think I'll do top-down for a change.. make it a bit different from the mass of side-scrollers that are more or less guaranteed to appear.

Traps:
Horizontal/Vertical crushers
Cameras ( symbolized by slow moving circles on the ground, and a box connected to a wall )
Lasers
Trap doors ( which open and close, naturally )
Spikes
Arrows

TECH NOTES:

States: Frontend Game Gameover Complete

Scrolling Camera : big playfield, tile based
Level Editor?

MISSING ENGINE BITS:
Audio .. should implement OpenAL
Physics... simple enough to do box/circle collisions
Most other things, actually...

Day One: Get all engine framework and logic done
Day Two: Content
Day Three: PROFIT!!!
